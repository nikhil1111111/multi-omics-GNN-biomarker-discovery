# Multi-Omics Biomarker Discovery using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

This project focuses on multi-omics biomarker discovery by integrating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics data into a graph-based framework. Using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), it models complex biological interactions (genesâ€“proteinsâ€“pathways) to:

Predict disease onset and progression (e.g., renal, cardiovascular, cancer).

Identify novel biomarkers that play a critical role in disease mechanisms.

Enable precision medicine insights by linking omics layers into one AI-driven pipeline.

Unlike traditional single-omics machine learning approaches, this project leverages heterogeneous graphs and deep learning to capture multi-level biological relationships, making it a rare and cutting-edge approach in bioinformatics.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- Integrates **multi-omics data** (from GEO, TCGA, STRING DB).
- Builds **heterogeneous biological graphs** (genesâ€“proteinsâ€“pathways).
- Applies **Graph Neural Networks (PyTorch Geometric)** for disease classification.
- Outputs **potential biomarkers** ranked by importance.
